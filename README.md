Automated Student Attendance Monitoring and Analytics System for Colleges

Attendance tracking in most colleges is still done manually, usually through roll calls or paper registers. This consumes valuable teaching time and often leads to errors such as incorrect entries or proxy attendance. In larger classes, the issue becomes even harder to manage.

Additionally, faculty and administrators lack easy access to attendance insights, making it difficult to identify students at risk or to track patterns in engagement. As education undergoes digital transformation, continuing to rely on outdated systems creates unnecessary inefficiencies and delays.

There is a clear need for a solution that not only automates attendance but also provides analytics for better academic planning. Such a system should be user-friendly, reliable, and work seamlessly in both in-person and online settings.
